<h2>Project Introduction</h2> 
  <p>
The Bank of England (BOE) plays a critical role in maintaining economic stability and market confidence. Central to this function is the Bank's strategic use of speeches its representatives deliver at public forums. Indeed, central bank communication influences financial markets and increases the predictability of monetary policy. 
This report examines the relationship between BOE speeches and the broader economic landscape. By analysing speech content and aligning it with economic events, including global crises, potential opportunities, and key economic indicators, our objective is to address the following business questions:
    
1. How has sentiment changed over time? 
2. How does sentiment correlate with events? 
3. How does sentiment correlate with economic indicators?
4. Does sentiment have the power to predict market behaviour?

Principally, we analyse the sentiments expressed in these speeches. Understanding how sentiments correlate with subsequent market behaviours can help us discover whether the BOE's communication is reactive or if it exhibits proactive, predictive, or even prescriptive qualities. This could reveal how the BOE influences the economic narrative, potentially shaping policy outcomes and market reactions. 

Previous research indicates that central bank communications are a vital source of information, providing insights into their perspectives on current and future economic conditions. Our sentiment analysis of BOE speeches offers valuable contributions to understanding the BOE's role in affecting economic outcomes.

<h2>Methodology</h2>

The figure above maps our methodology for analysing the BOE speeches and their correlation with economic indicators, which we can categorise more broadly into 3 parts: __data sourcing, cleaning, and analysis__.

    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><strong>Economic Metrics</strong></td>
    <td>
      <ul>
        <li>Utilised Excel for initial processing, addressing missing values and inaccuracies through functions and filtering techniques.</li>
        <li>Python used to standardise date formats to YYYY-MM and facilitate data export to GitHub, ensuring collaborative efficiency.</li>
      </ul>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><strong>Sentiment Analysis</strong></td>
    <td>
      <ul>
        <li>Applied Valence Aware Dictionary and Sentiment Reasoner (VADER) for initial sentiment assessment, establishing a baseline sentiment.</li>

  <tr>
    <td><strong>Statistical Testing</strong></td>
    <td>
      <ul>
        <li>Conducted correlation analysis (Pearsonâ€™s and Spearman's coefficients) to identify relationships between sentiment and economic indicators.</li>
        <li>Performed time-lag and cross-correlation analysis, along with Granger causality tests, to explore causal relationships.</li>
        <li>Utilised linear and time series regression models to understand and quantify these relationships.</li>
