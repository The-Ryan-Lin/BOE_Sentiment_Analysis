<h1>Sentiment Analysis of Bank of England Speeches</h1>

<h2>Project Introduction</h2> 
  <p>
The Bank of England (BOE) plays a critical role in maintaining economic stability and market confidence. Central to this function is the Bank's strategic use of speeches its representatives deliver at public forums. Indeed, central bank communication influences financial markets and increases the predictability of monetary policy. 
This report examines the relationship between BOE speeches and the broader economic landscape. By analysing speech content and aligning it with economic events, including global crises, potential opportunities, and key economic indicators, our objective is to address the following business questions:
    
1. How has sentiment changed over time? 
2. How does sentiment correlate with events? 
3. How does sentiment correlate with economic indicators?
4. Does sentiment have the power to predict market behaviour?

Principally, we analyse the sentiments expressed in these speeches. Understanding how sentiments correlate with subsequent market behaviours can help us discover whether the BOE's communication is reactive or if it exhibits proactive, predictive, or even prescriptive qualities. This could reveal how the BOE influences the economic narrative, potentially shaping policy outcomes and market reactions. Prior research has shown that central bank communication reveals information about their views on current and future economic conditions, thereby affecting economic outcomes. 


    In the complex world of economics and finance, the Bank of England (BOE) stands as a pivotal entity, influencing market confidence and economic stability. The speeches delivered by BOE representatives at public forums are more than ceremonial; they are strategic tools of communication that significantly impact financial markets and monetary policy predictability.

This project delves into the intricate relationship between the content of BOE speeches and the broader economic landscape. Our analysis focuses on dissecting the sentiments expressed in these speeches and aligning them with key economic events, global crises, and economic indicators. Through this, we aim to unravel the following critical business questions:

How has sentiment in BOE speeches changed over time?
What is the correlation between sentiment in these speeches and major economic events?
How does sentiment align with key economic indicators?
Can sentiment in BOE speeches predict market behavior?
Our primary goal is to understand the nature of sentiments conveyed in BOE speeches and their correlation with subsequent market behaviors. This analysis seeks to uncover whether the BOE's communication strategy is reactive, or if it demonstrates proactive, predictive, or prescriptive qualities. Such insights are crucial in determining how the BOE may be shaping economic narratives, influencing policy outcomes, and steering market reactions.

Previous research indicates that central bank communications are a vital source of information, providing insights into their perspectives on current and future economic conditions. Therefore, our sentiment analysis of BOE speeches could offer valuable contributions to understanding the BOE's role in affecting economic outcomes.

<h2>Assignment Overview</h2> 
  <p>
The goal of this project was to explore NHS appointment data within primary care and determine what can be done to reduce and eliminate missed appointments by investigating two main areas of capacity and resource utilisation in the NHS.

Four datasets were used in this analysis and can be found in the repository. The first three datasets contain primary care appointment data in the NHS and the last dataset is health-related tweets scraped from Twitter.
